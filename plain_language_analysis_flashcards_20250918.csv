"Field Properties: What are the five fundamental properties that define a field?","Addition and multiplication are commutative; both operations are associative; multiplication distributes over addition; there exist additive and multiplicative identities; every element has an additive inverse and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse."
"Supremum Definition: What does it mean for a real number to be the supremum of a set?","A real number is the supremum of a set if it is an upper bound for the set, and no number smaller than it is also an upper bound. In other words, it is the least upper bound."
"Mathematical Induction: What are the two key components needed for a proof by mathematical induction?","First, you must prove the base case - that the statement is true for the initial value. Second, you must prove the inductive step - that if the statement is true for some integer n, then it is also true for n plus one."
"Sequence Convergence: When do we say that a sequence converges to a limit?","A sequence converges to a limit L if for every positive number epsilon, there exists a positive integer N such that all terms beyond the Nth term are within epsilon distance of L."
"Limit Superior and Inferior: How are the limit superior and limit inferior of a sequence defined?","The limit superior is the limit of the sequence of suprema of tail sets, while the limit inferior is the limit of the sequence of infima of tail sets. They capture the eventual upper and lower bounds of sequence behavior."
"Function Limit: What does it mean for a function to approach a limit L as x approaches a point?","The function approaches limit L as x approaches a point if the function values can be made arbitrarily close to L by taking x sufficiently close to the point, regardless of the function value at that point."
"Continuity: When is a function continuous at a point?","A function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as we approach that point equals the function value at that point. Equivalently, small changes in input produce small changes in output."
"Intermediate Value Theorem: What does the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantee?","If a function is continuous on a closed interval and takes on two different values at the endpoints, then it must take on every value between those two values at some point in the interval."
"Derivative Definition: How is the derivative of a function defined?","The derivative at a point is the limit of the difference quotient as the change in input approaches zero. It represents the instantaneous rate of change or the slope of the tangent line."
"Mean Value Theorem: What does the Mean Value Theorem state?","If a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then there exists at least one point where the instantaneous rate of change equals the average rate of change over the entire interval."
"Series Convergence: When does an infinite series converge?","An infinite series converges if the sequence of its partial sums converges to a finite limit. This means the sum of all terms approaches a definite finite value."
"Absolute Convergence: What is the difference between absolute and conditional convergence of a series?","A series converges absolutely if the series of absolute values of its terms converges. A series converges conditionally if it converges but does not converge absolutely. Absolute convergence is stronger than conditional convergence."
"Uniform Convergence: How does uniform convergence differ from pointwise convergence?","Pointwise convergence means the sequence converges at each individual point. Uniform convergence means the sequence converges at the same rate everywhere - the convergence is uniform across the entire domain."
"Power Series: What is a power series and what determines where it converges?","A power series is an infinite series where each term contains a variable raised to increasing powers. The radius of convergence determines the interval where the series converges, found using the ratio test or root test."
"Taylor Series: What is the purpose of a Taylor series?","A Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. It allows us to approximate complicated functions using polynomials."
"Cauchy Convergence Criterion: What does the Cauchy convergence criterion tell us about sequences?","A sequence converges if and only if it is Cauchy - meaning that terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to each other as we go far enough out in the sequence, regardless of what they converge to."
"Monotonic Sequences: What special property do bounded monotonic sequences have?","Every bounded monotonic sequence converges. If a sequence is increasing and bounded above, it converges to its supremum. If decreasing and bounded below, it converges to its infimum."
"Completeness Axiom: What does the completeness axiom say about the real numbers?","Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a supremum (least upper bound). This property distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers and ensures no ""gaps"" exist."
"Comparison Test: How does the comparison test work for series?","If you have a series with nonnegative terms that are each smaller than or equal to the corresponding terms of a known convergent series, then your series also converges. If your terms are larger than those of a known divergent series, your series diverges."
"Ratio Test: When does the ratio test tell us a series converges or diverges?","If the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than one, the series converges absolutely. If the limit is greater than one, the series diverges. If the limit equals one, the test is inconclusive."
"Deleted Neighborhood: What is a deleted neighborhood?","A deleted neighborhood of a point is a set that contains every point of some neighborhood of that point except for the point itself. For example, all points within a certain distance of a point, but not including the point itself."
"Field: What is a field?","A field is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy five key properties: both operations are commutative and associative, multiplication distributes over addition, there exist additive and multiplicative identity elements, and every element has an additive inverse while every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse."
"Supremum: What is the supremum of a set?","The supremum of a set is the least upper bound. It is an upper bound for the set, but no number smaller than it is also an upper bound. The supremum may or may not actually belong to the set."
"Infimum: What is the infimum of a set?","The infimum of a set is the greatest lower bound. It is a lower bound for the set, but no number larger than it is also a lower bound. The infimum may or may not actually belong to the set."
"Divergence Test: What does the divergence test tell us?","If the terms of a series don't approach zero, then the series must diverge. This is only useful for proving divergence - if the terms do approach zero, the test tells us nothing about whether the series converges or diverges."
"Comparison Test: How does the comparison test work?","If you have a series with positive terms that are always smaller than the terms of a known convergent series, then your series converges too. If your terms are always larger than the terms of a known divergent series, then your series diverges."
"Limit Comparison Test: How does the limit comparison test work?","If you have two series with positive terms and the ratio of their terms approaches a positive finite limit, then both series have the same convergence behavior - they either both converge or both diverge."
"Ratio Test: How does the ratio test determine convergence?","Look at the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms. If this limit is less than one, the series converges absolutely. If greater than one, it diverges. If exactly one, the test gives no information."
"Root Test: How does the root test work?","Take the nth root of the absolute value of the nth term and find the limit. If this limit is less than one, the series converges absolutely. If greater than one, it diverges. If exactly one, the test is inconclusive."
"Integral Test: When can you use the integral test?","The integral test applies when your series terms come from a positive, decreasing function. The series and the corresponding improper integral either both converge or both diverge together."
"Alternating Series Test: What does the alternating series test require?","For an alternating series to converge, the absolute values of the terms must decrease monotonically to zero. If both conditions are met, the series converges, though not necessarily absolutely."
"Dirichlet's Test: When does Dirichlet's test apply?","Dirichlet's test works when you have a product of two sequences: one where the partial sums are bounded, and another that decreases monotonically to zero. The product series will converge."
"Abel's Test: What are the conditions for Abel's test?","Abel's test applies when you have a convergent series multiplied term-by-term with a bounded monotonic sequence. The resulting series will converge."
"Raabe's Test: When is Raabe's test useful?","Raabe's test is useful when the ratio test gives a limit of exactly one and is therefore inconclusive. It provides a more sensitive analysis by examining how quickly the ratios approach one."
"Condensation Test: How does the condensation test work?","For a decreasing sequence of positive terms, you can test convergence by looking at a ""condensed"" series where you group terms in powers of two. The original series and condensed series have the same convergence behavior."
"p-Series Test: What determines if a p-series converges?","A p-series has the form one over n to the p power. It converges if and only if p is greater than one. This is a fundamental benchmark series for comparison tests."
"Geometric Series Test: When does a geometric series converge?","A geometric series converges if and only if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one. When it converges, the sum equals the first term divided by one minus the ratio."
"Cauchy Condensation Test: What is the Cauchy condensation test?","If you have a decreasing sequence of positive terms, you can group them by powers of two. The original series converges if and only if the condensed series converges. This is particularly useful for series like the harmonic series."
"Weierstrass M-Test: How does the Weierstrass M-test work for uniform convergence?","If you can bound each function in a series by constants that form a convergent series, then the original series of functions converges uniformly. This provides an easy way to prove uniform convergence."
"Squeeze Theorem: How does the squeeze theorem work?","If you have three functions where one is always between the other two, and the outer two approach the same limit, then the middle function must also approach that same limit. It's useful when direct computation is difficult."
"Monotone Convergence Test: What does the monotone convergence theorem state?","Every bounded monotonic sequence converges. If a sequence is increasing and has an upper bound, it converges to its supremum. If decreasing with a lower bound, it converges to its infimum."
"Dominated Convergence Principle: What is the idea behind dominated convergence?","If a sequence of functions is dominated (bounded above) by an integrable function and converges pointwise, then you can interchange the limit and integral operations. The limit of the integrals equals the integral of the limit."
"Comparison Test for Improper Integrals: How do you compare improper integrals?","If your integrand is always smaller than the integrand of a known convergent improper integral, then your integral converges too. If always larger than a known divergent integral, yours diverges."
"Limit Comparison for Improper Integrals: When can you use limit comparison for integrals?","If the ratio of two integrands approaches a positive finite limit, then both improper integrals have the same convergence behavior. This is useful when direct comparison is difficult to establish."
"Cauchy's Root Test Details: What makes the root test work?","The root test essentially compares your series to a geometric series. The nth root of the nth term tells you what the ""effective ratio"" would be if your series were geometric. Geometric series with ratio less than one converge."
"Ratio Test Limitations: When does the ratio test fail to give information?","The ratio test is inconclusive when the limit of ratios equals one, or when the limit doesn't exist. In these cases, you need more sensitive tests like Raabe's test or direct analysis of the series behavior."
"Absolute vs Conditional Convergence Test: How do you determine the type of convergence?","First test if the series of absolute values converges - if so, you have absolute convergence. If the absolute value series diverges but the original series converges, you have conditional convergence. Use comparison or ratio tests on the absolute values."
"Convergence Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""if the terms go to zero, the series converges""?","This is backwards! If a series converges, then the terms must go to zero, but terms going to zero doesn't guarantee convergence. The harmonic series is the classic counterexample - the terms approach zero but the series diverges."
"Limit Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""the limit is the value the function approaches but never reaches""?","This is false. A limit is simply the value that the function approaches. The function might actually equal the limit value, might never reach it, or might even oscillate around it. The limit only cares about nearby behavior, not what happens exactly at the point."
"Continuity Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""a function is continuous if you can draw it without lifting your pencil""?","While this intuition helps, it's not precise enough. Some continuous functions are impossible to draw (like highly oscillating functions), and the ""pencil test"" depends on the scale and resolution of your drawing. The formal epsilon-delta definition is needed for precision."
"Derivative Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""if a function has a derivative at a point, it's continuous there""?","This is actually correct! The misconception is thinking the converse: that continuous functions are always differentiable. Many continuous functions have corners, cusps, or other features that prevent differentiability at certain points."
"Supremum Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""the supremum is always the largest element in the set""?","The supremum might not even be in the set! For example, the supremum of the open interval (0,1) is 1, but 1 is not in the set. The supremum is the least upper bound, which may or may not be achieved."
"Absolute Convergence Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""absolute convergence and conditional convergence are just different names for the same thing""?","These are fundamentally different! Absolutely convergent series behave like finite sums - you can rearrange terms freely. Conditionally convergent series are much wilder - rearranging terms can make them converge to any value you want or even diverge."
"Uniform Convergence Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""if a sequence of functions converges at every point, it converges uniformly""?","Pointwise convergence is much weaker than uniform convergence. A sequence can converge at every point but at wildly different rates, failing to be uniform. Uniform convergence requires the convergence to happen at the same rate everywhere."
"Infinity Misconception: What's wrong with treating infinity like a regular number?","Infinity is not a number in the real number system! Expressions like ""infinity minus infinity"" or ""infinity divided by infinity"" are undefined because infinity doesn't follow the usual arithmetic rules. You need careful limit analysis instead."
"Density Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""if the rationals are dense in the reals, there are more rationals than irrationals""?","Density is about how closely packed numbers are, not how many there are. Despite being dense, there are actually ""more"" irrational numbers than rational numbers in a precise mathematical sense (different cardinalities)."
"Compactness Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""bounded sets are automatically compact""?","In the real numbers, you need both closed AND bounded for compactness. The open interval (0,1) is bounded but not compact because it's not closed. Being bounded alone is insufficient."
"Series Rearrangement Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""you can always rearrange the terms of a convergent series""?","This is only safe for absolutely convergent series! For conditionally convergent series, rearranging terms can change the sum to any value you want or make the series diverge. This is a shocking and counterintuitive result."
"Function Limit Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""the limit of f(x) as x approaches a equals f(a)""?","This is only true if the function is continuous at point a. The limit describes behavior near the point, not at the point. The function might not even be defined at a, or might have a different value there."
"Cauchy Sequence Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""Cauchy sequences are just another name for convergent sequences""?","In complete spaces like the real numbers, these are equivalent. But in incomplete spaces, you can have Cauchy sequences that don't converge to anything in that space. The equivalence is what makes the real numbers ""complete."""
"Power Series Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""power series either converge everywhere or nowhere""?","Most power series have a finite radius of convergence - they converge inside some interval and diverge outside it. The behavior at the boundary points can vary. Only special power series converge everywhere or only at a single point."
"Monotonic Function Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""monotonic functions can't have discontinuities""?","Monotonic functions can have jump discontinuities! They can't have oscillating behavior, but they can have sudden jumps up or down. However, monotonic functions can only have countably many discontinuities."
"Test Failure Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""if the ratio test gives 1, the series diverges""?","When the ratio test gives a limit of 1, the test is inconclusive - it provides no information! The series might converge or diverge. You need to try a different test or approach when this happens."
"Nested Interval Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""nested intervals always contain infinitely many points""?","Nested intervals in the real numbers always contain at least one point, but not necessarily infinitely many. If the interval lengths approach zero, the intersection might be just a single point."
"Taylor Series Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""every function has a Taylor series that converges to it""?","Many functions don't have Taylor series at all (if they're not infinitely differentiable), and even when a Taylor series exists, it might not converge to the original function! The series might converge to something else entirely."
"Integration vs Differentiation Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""integration and differentiation are perfect inverses""?","Integration and differentiation are almost inverses, but not quite. When you differentiate then integrate, you lose the constant of integration. When you integrate then differentiate, you might lose information about discontinuities."
"Epsilon Choice Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""epsilon must be very small"" in limit definitions?","Epsilon can be any positive number! The definition says ""for every epsilon greater than zero"" - this includes large numbers like 100. The key is that you must be able to make the definition work for ALL positive epsilons, no matter how small."
"Test Selection Strategy: How do you choose which convergence test to use?","Start with the divergence test if terms don't approach zero. For positive series, try ratio or root tests if there are factorials or exponentials. Use comparison tests for rational functions. Try the integral test for series coming from functions. Use alternating series test for alternating series."
"Complete Ordered Field: What is a complete ordered field?","A complete ordered field is a field that has an ordering relation and satisfies the completeness axiom. The real number system is essentially the only complete ordered field - any other such system would differ only in notation."
"Extended Real Numbers: What are the extended real numbers?","The extended real numbers are the ordinary real numbers together with positive infinity and negative infinity. Arithmetic operations are defined for these symbols to simplify statements of theorems, though some combinations remain undefined."
"Indeterminate Forms: What are indeterminate forms?","Indeterminate forms are undefined expressions that arise in limits, such as zero divided by zero, infinity minus infinity, zero times infinity, infinity divided by infinity, and zero divided by zero. They require special techniques to evaluate."

"Interior Point: What is an interior point of a set?","A point is an interior point of a set if the set contains some epsilon-neighborhood of that point. This means you can move slightly in any direction from the point and still remain within the set."
"Open Set: What is an open set?","A set is open if every point in the set is an interior point. This means that around every point in the set, there is some small neighborhood that is entirely contained within the set."
"Closed Set: What is a closed set?","A set is closed if its complement is open. Equivalently, a set is closed if it contains all of its limit points - points that can be approached arbitrarily closely by other points in the set."
"Limit Point: What is a limit point of a set?","A point is a limit point of a set if every deleted neighborhood of that point contains at least one point from the set. The limit point itself may or may not belong to the set."
"Boundary Point: What is a boundary point of a set?","A point is a boundary point of a set if every neighborhood of that point contains both points that are in the set and points that are not in the set. Boundary points lie on the ""edge"" between the set and its complement."
"Boundary of a Set: What is the boundary of a set?","The boundary of a set is the collection of all boundary points of that set. It forms the ""edge"" or ""frontier"" between the set and its complement."
"Closure of a Set: What is the closure of a set?","The closure of a set is the union of the set with its boundary. It is the smallest closed set that contains the original set, obtained by adding all the boundary points."
"Isolated Point: What is an isolated point of a set?","A point is an isolated point of a set if it belongs to the set but there exists some neighborhood of that point which contains no other points from the set. The point is ""isolated"" from other points in the set."
"Exterior Point: What is an exterior point of a set?","A point is exterior to a set if it is an interior point of the set's complement. This means there is some neighborhood of the point that lies entirely outside the original set."
"Open Covering: What is an open covering?","An open covering of a set is a collection of open sets whose union contains the entire set. Every point in the set must belong to at least one of the open sets in the collection."
"Compact Set: What is a compact set?","A compact set is one that has the Heine-Borel property: every open covering has a finite subcovering. In the real numbers, this is equivalent to being closed and bounded."
"Bounded Above: What does it mean for a function to be bounded above?","A function is bounded above on a set if there exists a real number M such that the function value is less than or equal to M for all points in the set."
"Bounded Below: What does it mean for a function to be bounded below?","A function is bounded below on a set if there exists a real number m such that the function value is greater than or equal to m for all points in the set."
"Bounded Function: What does it mean for a function to be bounded?","A function is bounded on a set if it is both bounded above and bounded below on that set. Equivalently, there exists a positive number M such that the absolute value of the function is always less than M."
"Uniform Continuity: What is uniform continuity?","A function is uniformly continuous on a set if for every positive epsilon, there exists a positive delta that works for all points in the set simultaneously. The same delta works everywhere, unlike regular continuity where delta may depend on the specific point."
"Singleton Set: What is a singleton set?","A singleton set is a set that contains exactly one element. It is the simplest non-empty set possible."
"Disjoint Sets: What are disjoint sets?","Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is empty - they have no elements in common."
"Axiom: What is an axiom?","An axiom is a statement that is accepted as true without proof. Axioms serve as the fundamental building blocks or starting assumptions from which all other mathematical results are derived through logical reasoning."
"Theorem: What is a theorem?","A theorem is a mathematical statement that has been proven to be true using logical reasoning from axioms, definitions, and previously proven results. Theorems are the main results in mathematics."
"Lemma: What is a lemma?","A lemma is a proven mathematical statement that is primarily used as a stepping stone to prove a more important theorem. It's like a ""helper theorem"" that makes the proof of the main result easier or clearer."
"Corollary: What is a corollary?","A corollary is a mathematical statement that follows easily and directly from a theorem that has just been proven. It's an immediate consequence that requires little or no additional proof."
"Definition: What is a mathematical definition?","A definition is a precise statement that explains exactly what a mathematical term or concept means. Definitions establish the meaning of words and symbols so that everyone uses them consistently."
"Proof: What is a mathematical proof?","A proof is a logical argument that demonstrates why a mathematical statement must be true. It uses axioms, definitions, and previously proven results to show that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises."
"Counterexample: What is a counterexample?","A counterexample is a specific example that shows a general statement is false. Finding just one counterexample is sufficient to disprove a claim that something is always true."
"Necessary Condition: What is a necessary condition?","A necessary condition is something that must be true for a statement to hold. If A is necessary for B, then whenever B is true, A must also be true. However, A being true doesn't guarantee B is true."
"Sufficient Condition: What is a sufficient condition?","A sufficient condition is something that guarantees a statement will hold. If A is sufficient for B, then whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, B can be true even when A is false."
"Real Analysis Overview: What is the main goal of real analysis?","Real analysis provides the rigorous foundation for calculus by precisely defining concepts like limits, continuity, and convergence. It fills in the logical gaps left by computational calculus and proves that the techniques actually work."
"Compactness Connections: How do different characterizations of compactness relate?","In the real numbers, the following are equivalent for a set: being compact, being closed and bounded, having the Heine-Borel property, and having the property that every sequence has a convergent subsequence."
"Heine-Borel Theorem: What does the Heine-Borel Theorem state?","In the real numbers, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. This fundamental theorem connects the topological property of compactness with the more intuitive geometric properties of being closed and bounded."
"Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem: What does the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem guarantee?","Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. Even if the original sequence doesn't converge, you can always extract infinitely many terms that do converge to some limit."
"L'Hôpital's Rule: When can you apply L'Hôpital's rule?","L'Hôpital's rule applies when you have an indeterminate form like zero over zero or infinity over infinity. You can find the limit by taking derivatives of the numerator and denominator separately."
"One-Sided Limits: What are one-sided limits?","A one-sided limit considers the behavior of a function as you approach a point from only one direction - either from the left or from the right. Both one-sided limits must exist and be equal for a two-sided limit to exist."
"Rolle's Theorem: What does Rolle's Theorem state?","If a function is continuous on a closed interval, differentiable on the open interval, and has equal values at both endpoints, then there exists at least one point in the interior where the derivative equals zero."
"Common Misconception: What's wrong with thinking ""open"" and ""closed"" are opposites?","In topology, ""open"" and ""closed"" are not opposites. A set can be both open and closed (like the real line), neither open nor closed (like a half-open interval), or just one but not the other. The complement of an open set is closed, but that doesn't make them opposites."
"If and Only If: What does ""if and only if"" mean?","""If and only if"" means that two statements are equivalent - they're either both true or both false. It combines both necessary and sufficient conditions: A if and only if B means A is true precisely when B is true."
"Upper Bound: What is an upper bound?","An upper bound for a set is any number that is greater than or equal to every element in the set. A set can have many upper bounds, and if it has any upper bounds, it has infinitely many."
"Lower Bound: What is a lower bound?","A lower bound for a set is any number that is less than or equal to every element in the set. A set can have many lower bounds, and if it has any lower bounds, it has infinitely many."
"Bounded Set: What is a bounded set?","A set is bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below. This means all elements of the set lie within some finite interval - they don't spread out infinitely in either direction."
"Neighborhood: What is a neighborhood?","A neighborhood of a point is any set that contains an open interval around that point. The key idea is that you can move slightly from the point in any direction and still stay within the neighborhood."
"Sequence: What is a sequence?","A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, usually infinitely long, where each number corresponds to a positive integer position. You can think of it as a function from positive integers to real numbers."
"Subsequence: What is a subsequence?","A subsequence is formed by selecting infinitely many terms from the original sequence while keeping them in their original order. You're ""thinning out"" the sequence but not rearranging what remains."
"Convergence: What does convergence mean?","Convergence means that something approaches a specific value as a limiting process continues. For sequences, it means the terms get arbitrarily close to some fixed number as you go further out in the sequence."
"Divergence: What does divergence mean?","Divergence means that something does not approach any finite limit. A divergent sequence either grows without bound, oscillates, or behaves chaotically rather than settling down to a specific value."
"Limit: What is a limit?","A limit is the value that something approaches as a process continues indefinitely. It captures the idea of ""getting arbitrarily close to"" without necessarily ever reaching that exact value."
"Function: What is a function?","A function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. It's a way of describing how one quantity depends on another, ensuring that each input produces a unique result."
"Domain: What is the domain of a function?","The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined. It tells you what values you're allowed to ""plug in"" to the function."
"Range: What is the range of a function?","The range of a function is the set of all possible output values that the function can produce. It's the collection of all values that actually get ""spit out"" by the function."

"Discontinuous Function: What is a discontinuous function?","A discontinuous function has at least one point where it ""breaks"" - there's a jump, gap, or sudden change in value. The function is not continuous at such points."
"Series: What is an infinite series?","An infinite series is the sum of infinitely many numbers. Even though you can't literally add infinitely many things, the series ""converges"" if the partial sums approach a finite limit."
"Partial Sum: What is a partial sum?","A partial sum is the result of adding up the first several terms of an infinite series. As you include more and more terms, you get a sequence of partial sums that may converge to the series' total."
"Absolute Value: What does absolute value mean?","The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of direction. It's always non-negative and tells you ""how far"" a number is from zero without caring about positive or negative."
"Real Numbers: What are the real numbers?","The real numbers include all rational numbers (fractions) and irrational numbers (like pi and square root of 2). They fill the entire number line with no gaps, representing all possible measurements and quantities."
"Rational Numbers: What are rational numbers?","Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as fractions - the ratio of two integers where the denominator is not zero. This includes integers, finite decimals, and repeating decimals."
"Irrational Numbers: What are irrational numbers?","Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as fractions of integers. Their decimal representations go on forever without repeating. Examples include pi, e, and the square root of 2."

"Complement of a Set: What is the complement of a set?","The complement of a set consists of all elements that are not in the original set. It's everything ""outside"" the set within whatever universal context you're considering."
"Subset: What is a subset?","A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B. The subset relationship captures the idea that one set is ""contained within"" another."
"Proper Subset: What is a proper subset?","A set A is a proper subset of set B if A is a subset of B but A is not equal to B. This means A is contained in B but B has at least one element that A doesn't have."
